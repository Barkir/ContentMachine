"I can do that for three more days and I'll be very happy. And a victory would be awfully nice too."

"A victory? To me that comes off as a little cocky or brash. When you come out here, you know what I'm saying, your first pro tournament, you say, you know, I can win."

"I've always figured that why go to a tournament if you're not going there to try and win. As I always explained to my dad, second sucks and third's even worse. It's just a feeling I have."

"But on tour that's not too bad sometimes though."

"That's not too bad, but I want to win."

"You'll learn. I'm just kidding you, I'm sorry I had to say that. You'll learn."

"You know, I have learned something. I think you're better than I thought you'd be."
